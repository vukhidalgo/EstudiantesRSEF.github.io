  We inform that in response to the prevention and control actions due to the international alert on the COVID-19 pandemic, the Organizing Committee, along with IAPS EC, has made the decision to suspend this year's ICPS scheduled from August 9 to 16 in Puebla, Mexico.

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>
  This was a very difficult decision to make since we had proposed an edition in Mexico since 2016, and we have been preparing ICPS 2020 for more than two years. However, with the current information available on the situation in our country and the world, we know that this is the best way to proceed in order to keep participants, speakers, and volunteers safe.

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>
  We want to thank you for all the support you have given us, all the registered attendees who with great enthusiasm hoped to be part of a unique adventure in the first-ever ICPS in the Americas. Information about refunds will be provided soon directly to your emails. We also want to thank IAPS and the guest speakers, volunteers, workshop speakers. sponsors, universities, institutions, and allies that gave us their support.

  We wanted to offer you a once in a lifetime experience full of Mexican culture and gastronomic richness as we were preparing every detail of a full week filled with physics topics, excursions, and plenty of fun and tequila. The organizing committee is working on options to hold an ICPS Mexico in the near future, so if you were also excited about attending this ICPS, make sure to comment below.

  We are sad about this situation as you are, but in addition to providing you with the best experience, our responsibility is to guarantee your integrity over any other interest. We hope to have good news soon and we know we will go through this global situation together.
