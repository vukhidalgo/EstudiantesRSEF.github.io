## Contributing

Please read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/EstudiantesRSEF/EstudiantesRSEF.github.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before submitting pull requests.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning in this fashion:

  * Major version numbers X change incrementally whenever significant change to the website code is being introduced. For example, a large or potentially backward-incompatible change to the base code. These should always be developed in separated Git branches and never be merged except a global consensus by the Executive Committee is reached.

  * Common version numbers Y change incrementally whenever a new, minor feature is introduced, new content is released or when a set of smaller features is rolled out. These should be introduced using Pull Requests. These could be hold for a limited time in order to verify its integrity and mergeability.
  
  * Minor version numbers Z change incrementally whenever a critical or non-critical reversable patch or bug-fix is required. These are issued via Pull Requests and accepted as soon as possible in order to stabilize each Y version.
