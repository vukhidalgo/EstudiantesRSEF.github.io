Official website of the [Student's Group of the Spanish Royal Physics Society](https://estudiantes.rsef.es/), member of the [International Association of Physics Students](https://www.iaps.info/).

## Built With

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Main Github Pages Web Framework.
* [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/) - Forked CSS assets for a consistent look using Google's Material Design Guidelines.
* [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
* [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp)
* [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) - Content syntax.

## Contributing

Please read our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before submitting pull requests.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning in this fashion:

  * Major version numbers X change incrementally whenever significant change to the website code is being introduced. For example, a large or potentially backward-incompatible change to the base code. These should always be developed in separated Git branches and never be merged except a global consensus by the Executive Committee is reached.

  * Common version numbers Y change incrementally whenever a new, minor feature is introduced, new content is released or when a set of smaller features is rolled out. These should be introduced using Pull Requests. These could be hold for a limited time in order to verify its integrity and mergeability.

  * Minor version numbers Z change incrementally whenever a critical or non-critical reversable patch or bug-fix is required. These are issued via Pull Requests and accepted as soon as possible in order to stabilize each Y version.

## File Naming Convention

It is in our best practice to use the most simple syntax possible for any file while preserving the name and structure of the contents in Castilian Spanish and American English. Use lower cases, delimit words by hyphens, not spaces. Dates are written in reverse manner always, followed by the file name as described: {YYYY-MM-DD}-{name-of-file}.{extension}.

## Design

The website follows the ever changing [Google's Material Guidelines](https://material.io/design/) in order to provide a consistent experience to the users. However, we stick to the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), Keep It Stupid Simple Principle, whenever it is possible. The website is prepared for a future implementation as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
